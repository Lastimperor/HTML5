- How a Form Works

We can think of the internet as a network of computers which send and receive information. 
Computers need an HTTP request to know how to communicate.

The <form> element is a great tool for collecting information, but then we need to send that information somewhere else for processing.

ex.

<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <h1>Creating a form</h1>
  <p>Looks like you want to learn how to create an HTML form.</p>
</form>

the action attribute determines where the information is sent.
the method attribute is assigned a HTTP verb that is included in the HTTP request. 

- Text Input

If we want to create an input field in our <form>, we'll need the help of the <input> element.

The <input> element has:
a type attribute which determines how it renders on the web page and what kind of data it can accept.
a name attribute for the <input> â€” without the name attribute, information in the <input> won't be sent when the <form> is submitted.
default value for the value attribute so that users have a pre-filled text field when they first see the rendered form. 

ex. <input type="text" name="username" value="Davie">
