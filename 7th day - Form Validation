Validation is the concept of checking user provided data against the required data

There are different types of validation. 
One type is 'server-side validation', this happens when data is sent to another machine (typically a server) for validation. 
An example: 
The form on the login page accepts username and password input, 
then sends the data to a server which checks that the pair matches up correctly.

we use 'client-side validation' if we want to check the data on the browser (the client). 
This validation occurs before data is sent to the server. 
Different browsers implement client-side validation differently, but it leads to the same outcome.

- HTML5's built-in client-side validation. 
Shared among the different browsers and more benefits: 
 -saves us time from having to send information to the server and wait for the server to send back confirmation or rejection of the data. 
 -protect our server from malicious code or data from a malicious user. 
 -quickly feedback to users for specific fields rather than having them fill in a form again if the data they input into the form was rejected.
 
- Requiring an Input

Sometimes we have fields in our <form>s which are not optional, there must be information provided before we can submit it. 
To enforce this rule, we can add the required attribute to an <input> element. 

<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <label for="allergies">Do you have any dietary restrictions?</label>
  <br>
  <input id="allergies" name="allergies" type="text" required>
  <br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

 - Set a Minumum and Maximum
 
 Another built-in validation we can use is to assign a minimum or maximum value for a number field, 
 e.g. <input type="number"> and <input type="range">
 
 <form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <label for="guests">Enter # of guests:</label>
  <input id="guests" name="guests" type="number" min="1" max="4">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

- Checking Text Length

There are certainly cases where we wouldn't want our users typing more than a certain number of characters 
(think about the message cap for Twitter). 
We might even want to set a minimum number of characters.

I can use minlength and maxlength attribute and set a value

<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <label for="summary">Summarize your fillings in less than 250 characters</label>
  <input id="summary" name="summary" type="text" minlength="5" maxlength="250" required>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

- Matching a Pattern

we could also add a validation to check how the text was provided. 
For cases when we want user input to follow specific guidelines, 
we use the pattern attribute and assign it a regular expression, or regex. 
Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that make up a search pattern. 
If the input matches the regex, the form can be submitted.

Let's say we wanted to check for a valid credit card number (a 14 to 16 digit number). 
We could use the regex: [0-9]{14,16} which checks that the user provided only numbers and that they entered at least 14 digits and at most 16 digits.

<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <label for="payment">Credit Card Number (no spaces):</label>
  <br>
  <input id="payment" name="payment" type="text" required pattern="[0-9]{14,16}">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
