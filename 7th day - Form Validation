Validation is the concept of checking user provided data against the required data

There are different types of validation. 
One type is server-side validation, this happens when data is sent to another machine (typically a server) for validation. 
An example: 
The form on the login page accepts username and password input, then sends the data to a server which checks that the pair matches up correctly.
