DEPLOY YOUR WEBSITE TO GITHUB PAGES

- Create Your Repo

In order to publish your site using GitHub Pages, you'll need to create a repository (repo) on GitHub.

Your repo's name must also follow GitHub Pages' naming convention, otherwise your site will not publish at all.

Specifically, the repo's name must be in the following format:

your-user-name.github.io

- Initialize Your Repo

Great! Now that you've created a repo with the proper naming convention, let's upload your site to GitHub.

In the terminal, open a new tab.

Then, use the cd command to navigate to your site's directory.

Now that you're inside of your site's directory, initialize a Git repository with the following command:

'git init'
