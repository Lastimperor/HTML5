- HTML Anatomy

HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content.

Let's quickly review each part of the element pictured:

HTML element (or simply, element) — a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.

HTML Tag — the element name, surrounded by an opening (<) and closing (>) angle bracket.

Opening Tag — the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.

Content — The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.

Closing tag — the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. 
Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.

- Headings

in HTML, there are six different headings, or heading elements. 
Headings can be used for a variety of purposes, like titling sections, articles, or other forms of content.

The following is the list of heading elements available in HTML. 
They are ordered from largest to smallest in size.

<h1> — used for main headings. All other smaller headings are used for subheadings.
<h2>
<h3>
<h4>
<h5>
<h6>

- Divs

- Attributes

Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used in several different ways, 
from providing information to changing styling. 
Attributes are made up of the following two parts:

The name of the attribute
The value of the attribute

We can use the id attribute to specify different content (such as <div>s) and is really helpful when you use an element more than once

Attributes: 'id='
ex. <div id="badge">

- Displaying Text

If you want to display text in HTML, you can use a paragraph or span:

Paragraphs (<p>) contain a block of plain text.

<span> contains short pieces of text or other HTML. 
They are used to separate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.

- Styling Text

<em>      The <em> tag will generally render as italic emphasis.
<strong>  The <strong> will generally render as bold emphasis.

ex.
<p><strong>The Nile River</strong> is the <em>longest</em> river in the world, 
measuring over 6,850 kilometers long 
(approximately 4,260 miles).</p>

- Line Breaks

<br>    Line break

ex.
<p>The Nile River is the longest river <br> in the world, measuring over 6,850 <br> kilometers long 
(approximately 4,260 <br> miles).</p>
