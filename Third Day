HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. 
You can let web browsers know that you are using HTML by starting your document with a document type declaration.

The declaration looks like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>


-The <html> tag

To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags after declaring <!DOCTYPE html>:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>


- The Head

The <head> element goes above our <body> element.
The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. 
Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page. 

<head>
</head>

- Page Titles

the <head> element can contain metadata about the web page 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Coding Journal</title>
  </head>
</html>

- Linking to Other Web Pages

You can add links to a web page by adding an anchor element <a> and including the text of the link 
in between the opening and closing tags with href attribute. 
This attribute stands for hyperlink reference and is used to link to a path, or the address to where a file is located

ex. <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">This Is A Link To Wikipedia</a>

- Opening Links in a New Window

The target attribute specifies how a link should open.
For a link to open in a new window, the target attribute requires a value of _blank. 
The target attribute can be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, just like the href attribute.

ex. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank">The Brown Bear</a>

- Linking to Relative Page
