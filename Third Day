HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. 
You can let web browsers know that you are using HTML by starting your document with a document type declaration.

The declaration looks like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>


-The <html> tag

To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags after declaring <!DOCTYPE html>:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>


- The Head

The <head> element goes above our <body> element.
The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. 
Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page. 

<head>
</head>

- Page Titles

the <head> element can contain metadata about the web page 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Coding Journal</title>
  </head>
</html>

- Linking to Other Web Pages

You can add links to a web page by adding an anchor element <a> and including the text of the link 
in between the opening and closing tags with href attribute. 
This attribute stands for hyperlink reference and is used to link to a path, or the address to where a file is located

ex. <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">This Is A Link To Wikipedia</a>

LINKING

- Opening Links in a New Window

The target attribute specifies how a link should open.
For a link to open in a new window, the target attribute requires a value of _blank. 
The target attribute can be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, just like the href attribute.

ex. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank">The Brown Bear</a>

- Linking to Relative Page

When making multi-page static websites, web developers often store HTML files in the root directory, 
or a main folder where all the files for the project are stored. 
As the size of the projects you create grows, you may use additional folders within the main project folder to organize your code.

project-folder/
|—— about.html
|—— contact.html
|—— index.html

The example above shows three different files — about.html, contact.html, and index.html in one folder.

Because the files are stored in the same folder, we can link web pages together using a relative path.

ex. <a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>

On the web page, Contact will appear as a link.

A relative path is a filename that shows the path to a local file (a file on the same website, such as ./index.html) 
versus an absolute path (a full URL, like https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html which is stored in a different folder). 
The ./ in ./index.html tells the browser to look for the file in the current folder.

- Linking At Will

HTML allows you to turn nearly any element into a link by wrapping that element with an anchor element. 
With this technique, it's possible to turn images into links by simply wrapping the <img> element with an <a> element.

ex. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia" target="_blank"><img src="#" alt="A red prickly pear fruit"/></a>

an image of a prickly pear has been turned into a link by wrapping the outside of the <img> element with an <a> element.

- Linking to Same Page
