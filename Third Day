LET'S START

HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. 
You can let web browsers know that you are using HTML by starting your document with a document type declaration.

The declaration looks like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>

-The <html> tag

To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags after declaring <!DOCTYPE html>:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>

- The Head

The <head> element goes above our <body> element.
The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. 
Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page. 

<head>
</head>

- Page Titles

the <head> element can contain metadata about the web page 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Coding Journal</title>
  </head>
</html>

EXTRAS

- Whitespace and indentation

Programmers use two tools to visualize the relationship between elements: whitespace and indentation.
The spaces are inserted using the space and tab bars on your keyboard.
The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C recommends 2 spaces of indentation when writing HTML code. 

ex. <body><p>Paragraph 1</p><p>Paragraph 2</p></body>

You have to read the entire line to know what elements are present. 
Compare  to this:

<body>
    <p>Paragraph 1</p>
    <p>Paragraph 2</p>
</body>

- Comments

Comments begin with <!-- and end with -->. Any characters in between will be ignored by your browser.

ex. <!-- <p> Test Code </p> -->
