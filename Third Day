HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. 
You can let web browsers know that you are using HTML by starting your document with a document type declaration.

The declaration looks like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>


-The <html> tag

To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags after declaring <!DOCTYPE html>:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>


- The Head

The <head> element goes above our <body> element.
The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. 
Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page. 

<head>
</head>

- Page Titles
