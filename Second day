Unordered Lists (<ul> <li>)
An unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet point.

ex.
<ul>
  <li>Limes</li>
  <li>Tortillas</li>
  <li>Chicken</li>
</ul>

Ordered lists (<ol>) 
they are like unordered lists, except that each list item is numbered. 
They are useful when you need to list different steps in a process or rank items for first to last.

ex.
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
  <li>Mix whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
  <li>Cream the butter, sugar in separate bowl.</li>
  <li>Add eggs and vanilla extract to bowl.</li>
</ol>

Images
The <img> tag allows you to add an image to a web page.
The <img> tag has a required attribute called src. 
The src attribute must be set to the image's source, or the location of the image.

ex.
<img src="image-location.jpg" />

Image Alts
The alt attribute, which means alternative text, brings meaning to the images on our sites.

ex.
<img src="#" alt="A field of yellow sunflowers" />

Videos
The <video> tag requires a src attribute with a link to the video source. 
The <video> element requires an opening and a closing tag.
The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls: pause, play and skip.
"Video not supported", will only be displayed if the browser is unable to load the video.

ex.
<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
  Video not supported
</video>
