- Create a Table

Before displaying data, you must first create the table that will contain the data by using the <table> element.

<table>

</table>

The <table> element will contain all of the tabular data you plan on displaying.

- Table Rows

The first step in entering data into the table is to add rows using the table row element: <tr>.

<table>
  <tr>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  </tr>
</table>
In the example above, two rows have been added to the table.

- Table Data

Rows aren't sufficient to add data to a table. Each cell element must also be defined. 
In HTML, you can add data using the table data element: <td>.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>

- Table Headings

Table data doesn't make much sense without titles to describe what the data represents.

To add titles to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: <th>.
Just like table data, a table heading must be placed within a table row.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
    <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Temperature</th>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>

First, a new row was added to hold the three headings: a blank heading, a Saturday heading, and a Sunday heading. 
The blank heading creates the extra table cell necessary to align the table headings correctly over the data they correspond to.

In the second row, one table heading was added as a row title: Temperature.

Note, also, the use of the scope attribute, which can take one of two values:

row - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a row.
col - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column.

- Table Borders

n older versions of HTML, a border could be added to a table using the border attribute and setting it equal to an integer. 
This integer would represent the thickness of the border.

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The browser will likely still interpret your code correct if you use the border attribute, but that doesn't mean the attribute should be used. 
Instead, you can achieve the same effect using CSS.

table, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
